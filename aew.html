                On December 2, 2020, Sting made his All Elite Wrestling (AEW) debut after a tag team match that pitted Cody Rhodes and Darby Allin against Powerhouse Hobbs and Ricky Starks at Winter Is Coming. This was his first appearance on TNT since he defeated Ric Flair in the final episode of WCW Monday Nitro on March 26, 2001.</p>
            <p>
                 It was later announced that Sting had officially signed a multi-year contract with AEW.[161] AEW also began selling Sting merchandise. On the December 9, 2020 edition of Dynamite, Sting spoke for the first time on TNT in nearly 20 years, confirming to Cody Rhodes he was "signed officially with AEW." </p>

             <p> Sting then aligned himself with Allin, and on January 21, 2021, it was announced that Sting would team with Allin against Team Taz in a Street Fight at Revolution on March 7, marking Sting's first match since September 2015, thus coming out of retirement.
